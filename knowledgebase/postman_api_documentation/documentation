SalesHandy API responses are in JSON format. Every API call will return a valid JSON payload describing the object, operation performed or error details.
<br /><br />

### Success Response

    "error_message": "Could not connect with database."

```
<br />

### Global and/or Common Error Codes in Response
SalesHandy API utilizes HTTP status codes and custom error codes for error handling.<br />

HTTP Status Codes:<br />

**4xx** - Something wrong with request body, headers, resource access<br />
**5xx** - Server encounters an error<br />

There are following global and/or common error codes which describes specific error details:

====================
03. General Guidelines
====================
### Request Headers

Every request **MUST** have following headers set on request:

```
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Accept: application/json
X-SH-Source: <value>
X-Authorization-Token: <value>
```
<br />

> `X-Authorization-Token` header is required only for the requests where user MUST be logged in to access resources.

<br />

### Authorization Header

To identify that the request is made by valid user - API uses authorization header to be passed along with request. The resources which require user authorization, **MUST** pass authorization header to the request.

When user logs in - SalesHandy returns authorization token which is valid for 7 days. After that - user will have to login again. To generate authorization token - user will have to login with Login resource (later covered in documentation).

Login uses **Basic Auth** for authentication. Once user is logged in, all the resources which requires authorization, will need to pass `X-Authorization-Token` header to validate the request.

<br />

### Source Header

As mentioned earlier - SalesHandy APIs are utilized by SalesHandy Web Application, Chrome Plugin and Outlook Plugin. To identify that the request has come from which source, SalesHandy uses `X-SH-Source` header. Every request **MUST** send `X-SH-Source` header.


Valid values for `X-SH-Source` header:

| Value                 | Source                                            |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| WEB_APP               | SalesHandy Web Application                        |
| CHROME_PLUGIN         | Chrome Plugin                                     |
| OUTLOOK_PLUGIN        | Outlook Plugin                                    |
